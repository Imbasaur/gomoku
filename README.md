# Gomoku

Gomoku, also called Five in a Row, is an abstract strategy board game.

This open-source project aims to provide a place for playing Gomoku for everyone.

## Goal

 **One button matchmaking**: Enable people to play games without any overhead of creating accounts, searching for tables/open games, etc.
 
 **Catch-up with C# stuff**: Get along with the latest c# and .net features, as I am stuck on .net core 3.1 and C# 8.0
 
 **Learn front-end**: Learn basic stuff with the chosen front-end framework

## Optional
If the goal will be ever completed...

* Ingame/global chat
* Player accounts
* Leaderboard + rating system
* Saving/Loading games and playing them
* Public API for accessing played games
* Tournament system for private and public tournaments
* Analysis of played games (maybe integration with game engines?)
* Game variants (swap, swap2 etc)

## Technology
* .Net on backend
* Communication in WebSockets or MQTT (imagine integration with chess clock and interactive board IRL)
* TBC
